# vueTodoList

The app is intended as a todo list with reminders. I need to make some interface improvements as well as figure out a way to queue up the reminder requests and pass them into the server as their time is met. 

*to run the server cd into the fullstack dir and run 'npm run dev' this runs a script in the package.json that starts the server with nodemon.
